            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p>
                Technology has always been a passion for me, so it wasn’t a surprise when my study led me down this pathway. What was a surprise though, was ending up in Oil, Gas and Mining industries and seeing just how much technology now plays a part. It’s such a broad scope and all about building new systems to make life easier and safer for our people.
              </p>

            <p> Although its challenging to be out of my comfort zone, but constantly I push myself to take new opportunities to develop myself. This help me to learn  and I believe knowledge is my power.</p>
